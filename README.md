# hello-world
First git hub test repository for learning


Hi world,
This is my first step with github. Hoping to create many repositories/project for self learning purpose.
Having 5+ years of experience working on Big Data problems, I now look to enhance my skills with machine learning.
I am very excited to start with this new skill set.

Lets make it happen!!
